# GaiaOcean.github.io
Gaia Ocean is an environmental project made by high schoolers as their final paper for the environmental course. Its objective is to make society more aware of the downsides of plastic pollution to both marine animals and humans, by showing how it can negatively impact our health. This website was inspired by a template from BoostrapMade and adjustments were made so that it could perfectly fit our design.
