# GaiaOcean.github.io

Gaia Ocean is an environmental project created by high schoolers as their final paper for the environmental course. The objective is to raise awareness about the negative impacts of plastic pollution on marine life and human health.

## Inspiration and Source

The Gaia Ocean project was inspired by our research on the environmental challenges posed by plastic pollution. Through this initiative, we aimed to combine research and technology to educate others on the harmful effects of plastic waste on marine ecosystems and human health. Our goal was to create an engaging and informative platform that motivates sustainable practices and fosters a sense of responsibility toward protecting the environment.

This project is based on our final research paper, which can be accessed through this link : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QsGIBBEIq1VlvtkHqZD2CCmg5TbWXfT6/view?usp=drivesdk
